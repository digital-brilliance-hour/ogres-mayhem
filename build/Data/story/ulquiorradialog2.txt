Ulquiorra 0 I never expected to cross paths with you again.

Hero 0 Ulquiorra, why have you joined forces with Shrek? He's ensnaring powerful beings for his cause.

Ulquiorra 0 Shrek's power is beyond comprehension. He's misunderstood, just as I once was.

Hero 0 Misunderstood? He's manipulating powerful beings to create his world.

Ulquiorra 0 His world isn't about domination—it's about finding solace for those who've lost everything. Shrek lost everyone he loved.

Hero 0 But his methods are extreme!

Ulquiorra 0 Extreme, perhaps, but born of profound loss. His power draws in those seeking understanding, offering a haven for the disheartened.

Hero 0 I cannot let his vision become reality if it means chaos and upheaval.

Ulquiorra 0 Your resolve is unwavering, but in our clash, understand this—Shrek's motives might be misunderstood. His strength stems from the pain of losing everything he held dear.

Hero 0 Our battle is inevitable, Ulquiorra. But I fight for what's right.

Ulquiorra 0 And I, for what I've come to understand. Our clash will be legendary, but even in opposition, perhaps there's room for empathy and understanding.”
